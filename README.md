### Step 5: Configure Claude Desktop

Find your Claude Desktop config file:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

Edit the file to add the custom catalog:

#### Windows Example:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-toolkit-gateway": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-v", "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock",
        "-v", "C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\.docker\\mcp:/mcp",
        "-v", "C:\\logs:/mnt/logs",
        "docker/mcp-gateway",
        "--catalog=/mcp/catalogs/docker-mcp.yaml",
        "--catalog=/mcp/catalogs/custom.yaml",
        "--config=/mcp/config.yaml",
        "--registry=/mcp/registry.yaml",
        "--tools-config=/mcp/tools.yaml",
        "--transport=stdio"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### macOS/Linux Example:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-toolkit-gateway": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-v", "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock",
        "-v", "/Users/YourUsername/.docker/mcp:/mcp",
        "-v", "/var/log/linux-admin:/mnt/logs",
        "docker/mcp-gateway",
        "--catalog=/mcp/catalogs/docker-mcp.yaml",
        "--catalog=/mcp/catalogs/custom.yaml",
        "--config=/mcp/config.yaml",
        "--registry=/mcp/registry.yaml",
        "--tools-config=/mcp/tools.yaml",
        "--transport=stdio"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Configuration Notes:**
- The volume mount `-v YOUR_HOST_PATH:/mnt/logs` is optional but recommended for persistent logs
- If no log directory is specified, logs will be stored in `/tmp/linux-admin-logs` inside the container
- Replace `YourUsername` with your actual username

### Step 6: Create Your Log Directory (Optional but Recommended)

Choose and create your preferred log directory:

#### Windows:
```bash
# Option 1: Use C:\logs
mkdir C:\logs

# Option 2: Use a user-specific directory
mkdir C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\LinuxAdminLogs
```

#### macOS/Linux:
```bash
# Option 1: Use system log directory (requires sudo)
sudo mkdir -p /var/log/linux-admin
sudo chmod 755 /var/log/linux-admin

# Option 2: Use home directory
mkdir -p ~/linux-admin-logs
```

### Step 7: Restart Claude Desktop
1. Quit Claude Desktop completely
2. Start Claude Desktop again
3. The Linux Administration tools should now be available!

## Authentication Methods

The server supports multiple authentication methods, with credentials provided at runtime:

### 1. Password Authentication
Pass the password directly in the tool call:
```
"Connect to server.example.com with username admin and password mypassword"
```

### 2. SSH Key Authentication
Specify a key path in the tool call:
```
"Connect to server.example.com using key at /path/to/key"
```

### 3. Default SSH Keys
If no credentials are provided, the server will attempt to use:
- System default SSH keys (~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.ssh/id_ed25519, etc.)
- Any key configured in SSH_KEY_PATH environment variable (optional)

### 4. Integration with Secret Management
Designed to work with external secret management systems. Your application can:
1. Retrieve credentials from a secret server
2. Pass them to the Linux Admin tools at runtime
3. Never store credentials permanently

## Log File Organization

The MCP server organizes logs with the following structure:
- **Format**: `hostname-MMDDYYYY.json` (e.g., `webserver-01012025.json`)
- **Rotation**: Daily - new log file created each day for each host
- **Location**: Configured LOG_DIR directory (defaults to `/tmp/linux-admin-logs`)
- **Content**: JSON Lines format with all command execution details

### Log File Naming Examples:
- `production-server-01152025.json` - Commands run on production-server on Jan 15, 2025
- `database_local-01152025.json` - Commands run on database.local on Jan 15, 2025
- `192_168_1_100-01152025.json` - Commands run on IP 192.168.1.100 on Jan 15, 2025

Note: Special characters in hostnames are replaced with underscores for filesystem compatibility.

## Usage Examples

In Claude Desktop, you can use natural language commands:

### Basic Connection Test
```
"Test SSH connection to server 192.168.1.100 with username admin and password secret123"
```

### System Diagnostics
```
"Connect to webserver.example.com as root with my SSH key at /home/user/.ssh/web_key and check if it's running properly"
"Run full diagnostics on database server at 10.0.0.5 using password authentication"
```

### Service Management
```
"Check the nginx service status on production server (use admin account with password)"
"Restart MySQL on database.local using root account"
"Stop and disable Apache on web-server-01"
```

### Package Installation
```
"Install htop on server1.example.com (connect as admin)"
"Install docker on ubuntu-server.local using sudo user"
```

### Security Audit
```
"Check for security issues on my public-facing server (use key authentication)"
"Show me failed login attempts on auth-server"
"List all users with sudo access on prod-server"
```

### Log Analysis
```
"Find errors in the Apache logs on webserver"
"Search for 'connection refused' in system logs on db-server"
"Show me the last 100 lines of nginx error log"
```

### Network Diagnostics
```
"Test connectivity from web-server to database-server"
"Check if port 443 is open on api.example.com"
"Run traceroute from server1 to google.com"
```

### Audit Trail Review
```
"Show me all commands executed on production-server"
"What commands were run yesterday on any server?"
"Show failed commands from webserver for the last week"
"Get the current log status"
```

```

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- **No Hardcoded Credentials**: Server never stores credentials
- **Runtime Only**: Credentials are passed at tool invocation time
- **Multiple Methods**: Supports passwords, SSH keys, and system defaults
- **Secret Management Ready**: Designed to integrate with external secret servers

### Audit Logging
- **Complete Trail**: Every command is logged with timestamp, user, and outcome
- **JSON Format**: Structured logs for easy parsing and analysis
- **Daily Rotation**: Automatic daily log rotation per hostname
- **Configurable Location**: Choose your own secure log directory
- **Compliance Ready**: Suitable for regulatory compliance requirements

### Best Practices
1. Use SSH keys instead of passwords when possible
2. Integrate with a proper secret management system
3. Regularly rotate SSH keys and passwords
4. Review audit logs periodically
5. Use specific user accounts, not always root
6. Implement network segmentation for sensitive servers
7. Enable firewall rules to restrict SSH access
8. Use jump hosts for accessing production servers
9. Set up log rotation and archiving for long-term storage

## Log Format

Logs are stored in JSON Lines format (one JSON object per line):
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T12:00:00Z",
  "hostname": "server.example.com",
  "user": "admin",
  "command": "systemctl restart nginx",
  "output": "...",
  "error": "",
  "success": true
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### SSH Connection Issues
- Verify SSH service is running on target server
- Check firewall allows SSH port (usually 22)
- Confirm correct hostname/IP and credentials
- Test manual SSH connection first
- Check if password authentication is enabled on the server

### Tools Not Appearing in Claude
- Verify Docker image built successfully: `docker images`
- Check catalog file syntax: `cat ~/.docker/mcp/catalogs/custom.yaml`
- Ensure Claude Desktop config has custom catalog path
- Restart Claude Desktop completely

### Logging Issues
- Check if log directory exists and is writable
- Verify volume mount in Docker configuration
- Ensure sufficient disk space for logs
- Review Docker container logs: `docker logs [container_id]`
- Use `get_log_status` tool to check configuration

### Permission Denied Errors
- Verify user has sudo privileges on target server
- Check SSH key permissions (should be 600)
- Ensure service management commands are run as root or with sudo
- Check log directory permissions on host system

## Development

### Adding New Tools

1. Edit `linux_admin_server.py`
2. Add new function with `@mcp.tool()` decorator
3. Include password and key_path parameters for authentication
4. Use single-line docstrings only
5. Return formatted strings with status indicators
6. Update catalog with new tool name
7. Rebuild Docker image

### Testing Locally
```bash
# Run server directly with optional log directory
export LOG_DIR="/tmp/test-logs"  # Optional
python linux_admin_server.py

# Test MCP protocol
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/list","id":1}' | python linux_admin_server.py
```
