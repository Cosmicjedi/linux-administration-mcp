# Linux Administration MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides advanced SSH-based Linux server management with comprehensive command logging and audit trails.

## Overview

This MCP server enables AI assistants (like Claude) to connect to remote Linux servers via SSH, diagnose issues, execute commands, and perform administrative tasks while maintaining a complete audit log of all actions. It's designed for system administrators who want to leverage AI for server management while maintaining security and compliance through comprehensive logging.

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop with MCP Toolkit enabled

- Windows: C:\logs directory for audit logs
- macOS/Linux: /var/logs directory for audit logs

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cosmicjedi/linux-administration-mcp.git
cd linux-administration-mcp
```

### Step 2: Build Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t linux-admin-mcp-server .
```

### Step 3: Set Up SSH Authentication (Optional)
```bash
# For SSH key authentication
docker mcp secret set SSH_PRIVATE_KEY="$(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa)"

# For password authentication
docker mcp secret set SSH_PASSWORD="your-password"

# Verify secrets
docker mcp secret list
```

### Step 4: Create Custom Catalog
```bash
# Create catalogs directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p ~/.docker/mcp/catalogs

# Create custom.yaml
cat > ~/.docker/mcp/catalogs/custom.yaml << 'EOF'
version: 2
name: custom

### Step 5: Update Registry
```bash
# Edit registry file to add the server
cat >> ~/.docker/mcp/registry.yaml << 'EOF'
  linux-admin:
    ref: ""
EOF
```

### Step 6: Configure Claude Desktop

Find your Claude Desktop config file:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

Edit the file to add the custom catalog and volume mount:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-toolkit-gateway": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-v", "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock",
        "-v", "C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\.docker\\mcp:/mcp",
        "-v", "C:\\logs:/mnt/logs",
        "docker/mcp-gateway",
        "--catalog=/mcp/catalogs/docker-mcp.yaml",
        "--catalog=/mcp/catalogs/custom.yaml",
        "--config=/mcp/config.yaml",
        "--registry=/mcp/registry.yaml",
        "--tools-config=/mcp/tools.yaml",
        "--transport=stdio"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: Replace `YourUsername` with your actual username and adjust paths for your OS.

### Step 7: Create Logs Directory
```bash
# Windows
mkdir C:\logs

# macOS/Linux
sudo mkdir -p /var/logs
sudo chmod 777 /var/logs
```

### Step 8: Restart Claude Desktop
1. Quit Claude Desktop completely
2. Start Claude Desktop again
3. The Linux Administration tools should now be available!

## Usage Examples

In Claude Desktop, you can use natural language commands:

### Basic Connection Test
```
"Test SSH connection to server 192.168.1.100 with username admin"
```

### System Diagnostics
```
"Connect to webserver.example.com and check if it's running properly"
"Run full diagnostics on my database server at 10.0.0.5"
```

### Service Management
```
"Check the nginx service status on production server"
"Restart MySQL on database.local"
"Stop and disable Apache on web-server-01"
```

### Package Installation
```
"Install htop on all my servers"
"Install docker on ubuntu-server.local"
```

### Security Audit
```
"Check for security issues on my public-facing server"
"Show me failed login attempts on auth-server"
"List all users with sudo access on prod-server"
```

### Log Analysis
```
"Find errors in the Apache logs on webserver"
"Search for 'connection refused' in system logs on db-server"
"Show me the last 100 lines of nginx error log"
```

### Network Diagnostics
```
"Test connectivity from web-server to database-server"
"Check if port 443 is open on api.example.com"
"Run traceroute from server1 to google.com"
```

### Audit Trail Review
```
"Show me all commands executed today"
"What commands were run on production-server yesterday?"
"Show failed commands from the last week"
```

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- **SSH Keys**: Recommended for production use
- **Passwords**: Stored securely in Docker Desktop secrets
- **No Hardcoding**: Never hardcode credentials in the server code

### Audit Logging
- **Complete Trail**: Every command is logged with timestamp, user, and outcome
- **JSON Format**: Structured logs for easy parsing and analysis
- **Tamper-Proof**: Logs are append-only and stored outside the container
- **Compliance Ready**: Suitable for regulatory compliance requirements

### Best Practices
1. Use SSH keys instead of passwords
2. Regularly rotate SSH keys
3. Review audit logs periodically
4. Use specific user accounts, not always root
5. Implement network segmentation for sensitive servers
6. Enable firewall rules to restrict SSH access
7. Use jump hosts for accessing production servers

## Log Format

Logs are stored in JSON Lines format:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "hostname": "server.example.com",
  "user": "admin",
  "command": "systemctl restart nginx",
  "output": "...",
  "error": "",
  "success": true
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### SSH Connection Issues
- Verify SSH service is running on target server
- Check firewall allows SSH port (usually 22)
- Confirm correct hostname/IP and credentials
- Test manual SSH connection first

### Tools Not Appearing in Claude
- Verify Docker image built successfully: `docker images`
- Check catalog file syntax: `cat ~/.docker/mcp/catalogs/custom.yaml`
- Ensure Claude Desktop config has custom catalog path
- Restart Claude Desktop completely

### Logging Issues
- Verify logs directory exists and is writable
- Check volume mount in Docker configuration
- Ensure sufficient disk space for logs
- Review Docker container logs: `docker logs [container_id]`

### Permission Denied Errors
- Verify user has sudo privileges on target server
- Check SSH key permissions (should be 600)
- Ensure service management commands are run as root or with sudo

## Development

### Adding New Tools

1. Edit `linux_admin_server.py`
2. Add new function with `@mcp.tool()` decorator
3. Use single-line docstrings only
4. Return formatted strings with status indicators
5. Update catalog with new tool name
6. Rebuild Docker image

### Testing Locally
```bash
# Set environment variables
export SSH_KEY_PATH="/path/to/key"

# Run server directly
python linux_admin_server.py

# Test MCP protocol
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/list","id":1}' | python linux_admin_server.py
```
